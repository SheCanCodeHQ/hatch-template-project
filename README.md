# Celios

This project was developed during [hatchlondon 2017](http://hatchlondon.io).

Celios is a soil focused initative. Combining alerts to farmers, access to the knowledge to help them and implementation of smart contracts to assist funding of where soil needs recovery time.

## Problem and Solution

[We specifically address Sustainable Development Goal #15 "Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss". Although our solution is able to address other goals such as #2 also.]

In the past fourty years, the Earth has lost a third of arable land. Celios attempts to tackle this problem by giving information on soil degradation to farmers who are unable to afford to access the latest technology innovations such as satellites and microbes to combat pests. Celios gives farmers the opportunity to access information and help from 'citizen' (i.e. voluntary) farmers and scientists. A smart contract has also been included for further development of a staking and reward system for funding land use purposes (such as rent or future yields).
