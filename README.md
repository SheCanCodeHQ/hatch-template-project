## Problem and Solution
We aim to improve access to education among lower-income youths in the UK, by connecting them with mentors at various stages of their career. Each youth will be matched with a university student and an industry professional, where they can use our online platform to vhat and provide advice.

We believe that through this support system youths will be able to gain the motivation and support they need to further their education through university.

## Our Solution

Boss Boost is an online platform that matches youths, university students and industry professionals with similar interests and backgrounds, to create a support system for lower-income youths at risk of dropping out of high school. Through this system, we aim to provide mentoring and tutoring sessions, and career advice for youths (and university students) to succeed in and further their studies.
