# Food For Thought

A concept for connecting food providers with school children in need and student volunteers.

This project was developed during [hatchlondon 2018](http://hatchlondon.io).

## Team

* Tanisha Mandre
* Wenjie Boon

## Problem and Solution
- 500,000 children goes to school on an empty stomach daily.
- 900,000 edible meals ends up in the bins everyday because it could not be sold by restaurants and cafes.
- 71% of students would volunteer if it was more flexible.

Food For Thought brings everyone together and solves all 3 problems at once.

We are feeding hungry school children by taking unwanted food off businesses, and provide university students access to flexible volunteering opportunities to deliver those food to where it matters.
